# Login-Form

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
<p> The website, is a simple login form created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design is modern and user-friendly, with a clean layout that is easy to navigate. The form features input fields for email and password, along with a "Remember Me" checkbox and a "Forgot Password" link. Upon submission, the user's credentials are verified, and they are either redirected to a dashboard page or prompted to re-enter their information. This login form is a great example of a basic authentication system that can be implemented on a variety of websites and applications.</p>
